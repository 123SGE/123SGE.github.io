  <div class="basic">
    <h1>"This is what an example of "h1" looks like."</h1>
    <h2>"This is what an example of "h2" looks like."</h2>
    <h3>"This is what an example of "h3" looks like."</h3>
    <h4>"This is what an example of "h4" looks like."</h4>
    <h5>"This is what an example of "h5" looks like."</h5>
    <h6>"This is what an example of "h6" looks like."</h6>
    <p>This is an example of what another line of code might look like.</p>
    <p><strong>Bold</strong> text can be added using "<strong>".</p>
    <p><em>Italic</em> text can be added using "<em>".</p>
    <p>The "<span>" property can be used to span a certain line of text and change small details in CSS such as <span id="spancolor">color</span>.</p>
    <p>Each of these begins with the listed tags surrounded by "< >"</p>
    <p>Additionally, each of these need to be closed with "h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, strong, em, and span" respectively. Each of those ending tags will be surrounded by "</ >".</p>
